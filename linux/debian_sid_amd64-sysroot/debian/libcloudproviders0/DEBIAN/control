Description: cloud provider library
 libcloudproviders is a glib based library that makes it easier to implement
 a cloud provider server or client.
 .
 libcloudproviders also provides a DBus API that allows cloud storage sync
 clients to expose their services. Clients such as file managers and desktop
 environments can then provide integrated access to the cloud providers
 services.
