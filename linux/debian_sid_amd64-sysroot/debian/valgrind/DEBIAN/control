Description: instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools
 Valgrind is a system for debugging and profiling Linux programs. With its tool
 suite you can automatically detect many memory management and threading bugs,
 avoiding hours of frustrating bug-hunting and making your programs more stable.
 You can also perform detailed profiling to help speed up your programs and use
 Valgrind to build new tools.
 .
 The Valgrind distribution currently includes six production-quality tools:
  * a memory error detector (Memcheck)
  * two thread error detectors (Helgrind and DRD)
  * a cache and branch-prediction profiler (Cachegrind)
  * a call-graph generating cache and branch-prediction profiler (Callgrind)
  * a heap profiler (Massif)
 It also includes three experimental tools:
  * a stack/global array overrun detector (SGCheck)
  * a second heap profiler that examines how heap blocks are used (DHAT)
  * a SimPoint basic block vector generator (BBV)
